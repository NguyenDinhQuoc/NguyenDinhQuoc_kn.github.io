Hi! Iâ€™m Khai, an second-year AI Research Resident at [VinAI Research, Vietnam](http://www.vinai.io) under the supervision of  [Dr. Nhat Ho](https://nhatptnk8912.github.io/) and [Dr. Hung Bui](https://sites.google.com/site/buihhung/).
## My work and research
My research interests are Optimal Transport (especially Sliced Optimal Transport), Generative modeling (including parameter estimation, Bayesian inference, etc), and their intersection.
